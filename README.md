# PGx Normalizer
An effort to provide a unified interface for parsing the output of common PGx Genotyping Tools into a stardardized format and combine their calls into a normalized result.

## Overview

The `PGx Normalizer` is a project designed to standardize and normalize pharmacogenomics (PGx) genotyping data from various tools. Its primary goal is to transform raw, tool-specific gene call outputs into a consistent, actionable format, resolving discrepancies, combining results and preparing data for clinical interpretation or downstream analysis.
